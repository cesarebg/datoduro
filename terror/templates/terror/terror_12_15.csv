Shortly after hijacking a civilian vehicle, the suspects were confronted by police, leading to a firefight that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and a police officer were both injured in the exchange. During the encounter, the suspects hurled explosives at the officers. It was later revealed that the Tsarnaev brothers were plotting to use the explosives to carry out an attack in an unconfirmed location. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested later that evening after he was discovered hiding in a boat that was parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts, resident's backyard. Tsarnaev had written a claim of responsibility on the side of the boat.
